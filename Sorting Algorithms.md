# Sorting Algorithms

## Properties of â€¨ Sorting Algorithms
A Sorting algorithm is:
* __in-place__ if it does not require additional memory except, perhaps, for a few units of memory
* __stable__ if it preserves the relative order of elements with identical keys
* __input-insensitive__ if its running time is fairly independent of input properties other than size
