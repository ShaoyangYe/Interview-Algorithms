# Sorting Algorithms

## Properties of â€¨ Sorting Algorithms
A Sorting algorithm is:
* __In-place__ if it does not require additional memory except, perhaps, for a few units of memory
* __Stable__ if it preserves the relative order of elements with identical keys
* __Input-insensitive__ if its running time is fairly independent of input properties other than size

## Selection Sort
While running time is quadratic, selection sort makes only about __n exchanges__

Selection sort is a good algorithm for sorting small collections of large records. (Good for small n)

makes only about n exchanges.

___In-place? Yes___

___Stable? Not stable___

___Input-insensitive? Yes___

__Best Time Complexity: O(n^2)__

__Worst Time Complexity: O(n^2)__
